# Projects
These are some of the projects that i have worked on in the data science field over the years.
Below are the description of the files that i have uploaded and i have worked on:
1. House Price Prediction: The main aim of this project is to predict house prices using Linear Regression. When you ask a home buyer to describe the dream house, they will obviously not begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to any nearby road. The dataset contained 78 columns that cover every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Lowa. The dataset can be found with the train and test files that i have uploaded
