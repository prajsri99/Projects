# Projects
These are some of the projects that i have worked on in the data science field over the years.
Below are the description of the files that i have uploaded and i have worked on:
1. House Price Prediction: The main aim of this project is to predict house prices using Linear Regression. When you ask a home buyer to describe the dream house, they will obviously not begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to any nearby road. The dataset contained 78 columns that cover every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Lowa. The dataset can be found with the train and test files that i have uploaded. The dataset has been taken from kaggle.
2. Project.R: This was a coursework project that i accomplished during my masters. The dataset for this project is the world bank invitational csv file that has been uploaded above. I have also included the report for this project which can be found in the file project.pdf
3. Diss: This is my dissertation that i am currently working on for my masters degree. diss.R file is not final, i will upload the R file after i complete the project. I have also included the MSc thesis which is temporary report of this project. The dataset aviation islands has been collected and cleaned. clean_missing_aviation is the dataset after cleaning and imputing the missing values. You can use the raw dataset aviation islands to perform your own exploratory data visualization and analysis.
